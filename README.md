# Session 12 - Packages
# EPAi Session12 Assignment

#### Objective of Assignment:
1. Build a calculator package that has separate module for:
    1. sin, cos, tan, tanh, SoftMax, Sigmoid, ReLU, log and e
    2. The modules shall include their derivatives as well
    3. If we do import calculator, we should be able to access all the above function (except deviratives)
    4. For derivates we must do: from package import derivatives. 
    5. Outputs are returned as well as printed using only f-string
    6. Write simple test cases to check the outputs of each operator and their derivative
